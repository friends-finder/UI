            Our goal at Friend Finder is to provide you, the user, with a unique
            experience unlike any other. In order to deliver the best
            experience, we've implemented a vast array of diverse features to
            facilitate the creation of new memories and help you connect with
            new and interesting people!

          <h1>Tailored to your interests</h1>
          <p>
            Upon account creation, you will be guided through the process of
            selecting an array of questions to survey as many of your interests
            as possible. You will be able to see people using friend finder's
            filtering feature to determine whether or not you would like to
            request a match. From there, you can select 'Match' or 'Move on".
            Clicking "match" sends a message to that person to notify them that
            you are interested in meeting them. You can see a page of users
            who've requested a match and either reciprocate with a "match or
            move on".

              Once matched, you can use the messaging app built in and start
              chatting with one another and coordinate times/places to meet up
              to casually make new friends! The Timeline feature allows you to
              share photos/videos from recent fun hangouts to extend an open
              invitation for new users in the area to join during the next
              event.
